KSP KerbalKonstructs Runway Markings and Signs

KerbalKonstructs is a wonderful mod allowing to create new structures on planetary surface. It also comes with several runways for aircraft/spaceplane operation. However, these runways lack markings such as heading, aim point, threshold etc. This is a humble attempt to fix it. 

It uses font from http://www.fsdeveloper.com/forum/threads/icao-runway-number-font.382011/

(As usual, copy the content into GameData directory. KerbalKonstructs must be installed.)
